### The Whats

- React - JavaScript library that creates user experience
- User experience - user interaction, UX, UI - user interface
- Library - collection of code snippets that create functionality, JavaScript: node_modules
- Package manager - yarn is a package manager, handles the organization of node_modules

### The Whys

- Scale - the ability to increase users
- Facebook created React so their app could scale
- 1. Need the code to be reusable
- 2. User interactions to be handled quickly and efficiently

### Reusable

- Functions, classes
  - Component - base structure of React, consist of JavaScript and markup (UI)
  - Components can be classes or functions, we will be using functions for our components

### Quickly and Efficiently

- React isolates where changes happen and only updates what is needed
- Virtual DOM - listens for changes, isolate the node
- DOM - document object model, the visual representation of code
- DOM tree - a series of nested markup tags
- Nodes - markup tags through the lens of the DOM
